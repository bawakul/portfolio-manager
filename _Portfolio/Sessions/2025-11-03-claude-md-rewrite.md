# Session: Claude.md Rewrite & Project Rename

## 2025-11-03 - Claude.md Rewrite & Project Rename

**Context**: Clarifying portfolio manager role and resolving naming conflicts

**Session Activities**:

1. **Digital Garden Metaphor Discussion**
   - Identified naming conflict: portfolio is a "digital garden" AND there's a project called "digital-garden"
   - User confirmed the portfolio IS a digital garden of projects
   - Decision: Rename the knowledge management project to avoid confusion

2. **Project Rename: digital-garden → knowledge-gardener**
   - Renamed local folder: `digital-garden` → `knowledge-gardener`
   - Updated `Notes.md` with new title and metadata
   - Renamed GitHub repo: `bawakul/digital-garden` → `bawakul/knowledge-gardener`
   - Clean separation: portfolio = digital garden of projects, knowledge-gardener = tool for managing Obsidian notes

3. **Claude.md Rewrite**
   - Added "Digital Garden Caretaker" subtitle to clarify metaphor
   - Explained why digital garden approach works vs traditional PM tools
   - **Clarified current vs future phase:**
     - Current: Building infrastructure (skills, automation, tools)
     - Future: Using those tools for portfolio management
   - **Clear boundaries:**
     - DO work on portfolio-manager (build skills, commit code, infrastructure)
     - DON'T work inside individual projects (they have their own Claude sessions)
   - **Corrected skills section:**
     - Implemented: `/init-project` only
     - Planned: `/status`, `/sync`, `/review`

**Outcomes**:
- ✅ No more naming confusion between portfolio metaphor and project names
- ✅ Portfolio manager role clearly defined with explicit boundaries
- ✅ Current transition phase acknowledged (more tool-building now, less later)
- ✅ Honest about what skills exist vs what's planned
- ✅ Digital garden metaphor properly established

**Files Changed**:
- Renamed: `digital-garden/` → `knowledge-gardener/`
- Modified: `knowledge-gardener/Notes.md`
- Modified: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (complete rewrite)
- GitHub: Renamed `bawakul/digital-garden` → `bawakul/knowledge-gardener`

**Next Actions**:
- Commit these changes to portfolio-manager
- Begin building next skills (`/status`, `/sync`, `/review`)
