When creating the audio overview:
- This is about Bawa's project work - what he built, decided, and learned this week
- He's the audience - he's listening to understand his own week
- Focus on key decisions, insights, and what matters for context going forward
- Keep it 5-10 minutes - highlight what's most important
- Help him reflect and think about what's next

The content below summarizes his week across multiple projects in his digital garden.

# Weekly Review: November 3 to November 9, 2025

**Generated:** November 9, 2025

## Executive Summary

This was an infrastructure and systems week across the portfolio. The major theme was improving the portfolio management foundations - you migrated all 17 projects to a clearer naming structure, added session auto-loading hooks everywhere, and started strategic planning for the review system itself.

You also built something fun: guitar-tab-viewer, a full-stack Go web app that came together in a single focused session. It was a nice break from meta-work, and you learned Go's module system and embedding features along the way.

The week wrapped with strategic thinking about the portfolio-manager's future - you created issues for both the /close-session automation and the longer-term vision of extracting this into a framework others could use.

**Active Projects:** 3 projects with meaningful activity this week (portfolio-manager, guitar-tab-viewer, knowledge-gardener)

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Migrated all 17 projects to [project-name].md structure
- Deployed session auto-load hooks across the portfolio
- Built complete guitar-tab-viewer web app in Go
- Created strategic issues for framework extraction and session automation
- Fixed frontmatter formatting issues across all projects

## Projects Active This Week

### portfolio-manager (Personal Tool) - Active

**What happened:** This was the most active project - you tackled three major infrastructure improvements. First, you completed the notes migration that was planned last week. Every project now has a uniquely-named notes file ([project-name].md instead of generic Notes.md), which solves the Obsidian tab confusion problem. You also cleaned up the frontmatter structure, changing `type:` to the clearer `project_type:`.

Second, you deployed the session auto-load hooks to all 17 projects. Now when you open any project in Claude Code, it automatically loads the most recent session notes (if they're less than 7 days old) to restore context. This should reduce the "where was I?" friction when jumping between projects.

Third, you had a strategic planning session about the portfolio-manager's evolution. You discussed whether to extract it into a reusable framework and decided to wait until the system stabilizes - probably 1-2 more months of real usage. You also explored the /close-session automation idea but decided it's low priority since the current workflow is working fine.

**Shipped:**
- Full notes migration: Notes.md → [project-name].md across 17 projects
- Session auto-load hooks deployed portfolio-wide
- Frontmatter cleanup: type → project_type
- Migration scripts: migrate-to-new-structure.py and add-bawa-notes-tag.py
- GitHub issues created: #11 (framework extraction), #12 (/close-session skill)

**Key insights:**
- User-facing naming matters more than technical consistency - the "Notes.md" pattern was technically clean but created UX friction in Obsidian
- Build for yourself first, framework-ify later - better to stabilize through real usage than prematurely abstract
- Session notes auto-loading is working well based on the hook deployment

**Next:** Build the core portfolio skills (/status, /sync, /review) to complete the toolkit. The /review skill planning started this week, with this very document being a test.

### guitar-tab-viewer (Personal Tool) - Active

**What happened:** You initialized and built this project in a single focused session on November 4. It's a web app that lets you search for guitar tabs and view them in a clean, readable interface. You discovered the ultimate-guitar-scraper Go package, wrapped it with an HTTP server, and built a simple dark-themed web UI.

This was your first time working with Go in this portfolio context. You learned about Go's module system (go mod init, go get), the embed directive for bundling static files into the executable, and how Go creates single portable binaries. The whole thing compiles to a ~12MB executable with the static files embedded.

**Shipped:**
- Complete web application (Go backend + vanilla JS frontend)
- Two API endpoints: /api/search and /api/tab/:id
- Dark theme UI optimized for reading guitar tabs
- Full project initialization via updated /init-project skill
- Deployed to GitHub: https://github.com/bawakul/guitar-tab-viewer

**Key insights:**
- Go is nice for simple web servers - single binary deployment is elegant
- The /init-project skill worked well for rapid project setup
- Building something functional (not just infrastructure) feels good

**Next:** You could enhance the UI with theme toggle, font controls, or favorites. Audio playback integration would be ambitious but cool.

### knowledge-gardener (Personal Tool) - Low Activity

**What happened:** Minor activity this week - you completed an inline tags migration and added Obsidian Publish CSS customization. The bulk of the work was migrating tags from frontmatter to inline format for better Obsidian integration.

**Shipped:**
- Inline tags migration tools
- Obsidian Publish CSS updates
- Session auto-load hooks (from portfolio-wide deployment)

**Next:** This project is in maintenance mode - no pressing next actions.

## Cross-Project Insights

**Themes:** This was primarily an infrastructure and tooling week. Most of the energy went into improving the portfolio management system itself rather than building individual project features. The guitar-tab-viewer was the exception - a burst of building something tangible.

**Learnings:**
- Migration scripts are powerful when they handle edge cases upfront - your scripts were idempotent and comprehensive, making the portfolio-wide changes smooth
- Strategic thinking should be captured as issues rather than acted on immediately - you resisted the urge to prematurely extract the framework
- Sometimes you need to build something fun (guitar tabs) to break up the meta-work

**Energy distribution:**
- Heavy portfolio infrastructure focus (60%)
- One focused build session (guitar-tab-viewer, 30%)
- Strategic planning and issue creation (10%)

## Portfolio Status

**Active (building now):**
- portfolio-manager - Infrastructure improvements, skill development
- guitar-tab-viewer - New tool, working MVP, ready for enhancements

**Paused (waiting for):**
- expense-splitter - Waiting on self-hosting skills (PocketBase learning roadmap)

**Infrastructure Improved:**
- All 17 projects: session auto-load hooks, improved notes structure, consistent frontmatter

**Momentum indicators:**
- Commits: 60+ across 16 projects (migration work)
- Sessions: 3 tracked (portfolio-manager × 2, guitar-tab-viewer × 1)
- Issues created: 2 strategic issues (#11, #12)

---

## The Week Ahead

With the migration work complete and hooks deployed, you're ready to focus on building the remaining portfolio skills. The /review skill (which is generating this very document) is being tested now. After this, /status and /sync would complete the core toolkit.

guitar-tab-viewer is ready to use - test it with some actual tabs and see what UI improvements would be helpful. You might discover UX friction that suggests next features.

The expense-splitter remains paused, waiting for your PocketBase learning. That's still a few weeks out based on the learning roadmap.

Knowledge-gardener is stable and working - no urgent action needed there.

Strategic issues (#11 framework extraction, #12 session automation) are captured for future consideration, but not immediate priorities.
