Session notes for portfolio manager maintenance and improvements.

## 2025-11-03 - Folder Rename Preparation

**Context**: Planning to rename portfolio folder from "vibecoding" to "Bawa's Lab"

**Session Activities**:

1. **Impact Analysis**
   - Searched codebase for hardcoded path references
   - Found hardcoded paths in `.claude/skills/init-project/skill.md` (lines 34, 35, 342, 357)
   - Verified no other breaking dependencies
   - Confirmed git remotes, Obsidian notes, and project code are unaffected

2. **Init-Project Skill Update**
   - Changed from hardcoded paths: `/Users/bharadwajkulkarni/Documents /Vibecoding/`
   - To dynamic relative paths from portfolio root
   - Updated 3 locations in skill.md:
     - Project directory creation (line 34-35)
     - Confirmation next steps (line 342)
     - Implementation notes (line 357)

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Created test project: `test-skill-validation`
   - Verified all file generation (Claude.md, README.md, LEARNING.md, Notes.md, .gitignore)
   - Tested git initialization and GitHub push
   - Confirmed dynamic paths work correctly
   - Cleaned up test artifacts

**Outcomes**:
- ✅ Init-project skill now folder-name agnostic
- ✅ Portfolio can be renamed without breaking tooling
- ✅ Test repo created: https://github.com/bawakul/test-skill-validation (manual cleanup needed)

**Next Actions**:
- Ready to rename folder to "Bawa's Lab"
- Reopen Obsidian vault after rename
- Optionally delete test GitHub repo

**Changes Made**:
- Modified: `.claude/skills/init-project/skill.md`
- Created: `SESSIONS.md`

## Session Continuation - Folder Renamed ✓

**Status**: Folder successfully renamed from "vibecoding" to "Bawa's Lab"

**Issue Encountered**:
- After renaming, bash shell working directory became invalid (stuck on old path)
- All bash commands failed because cwd no longer exists
- Read tool still worked (uses absolute paths)

**Pending Actions for Next Session**:

⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: The following changes need to be committed and pushed:

```bash
cd "/Users/bharadwajkulkarni/Documents /Bawa's Lab"
git add SESSIONS.md .claude/skills/init-project/skill.md
git commit -m "Update init-project skill for dynamic paths

- Remove hardcoded portfolio folder paths
- Use relative paths from portfolio root
- Add session tracking
- Rename folder: vibecoding → Bawa's Lab

🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
git push
```

**Files Modified (uncommitted)**:
- `SESSIONS.md` - This file (session tracking)
- `.claude/skills/init-project/skill.md` - Dynamic paths update

**Post-Rename Checklist**:
- ✅ Folder renamed to "Bawa's Lab"
- ✅ Obsidian vault reopened
- ✅ Commit pending changes
- ✅ Push to GitHub
- ✅ Verify `/init-project` skill works with new path
- ✅ Delete test repos

## 2025-11-03 - Post-Rename Completion & Skill Validation

**Context**: Completing the folder rename transition and validating all systems work

**Session Activities**:

1. **Git Commit & Push**
   - Committed SESSIONS.md and _Templates/Notes-Template.md
   - Pushed to GitHub successfully
   - Repository: https://github.com/bawakul/portfolio-manager

2. **Init-Project Skill Test**
   - Ran `/init-project` skill to verify dynamic paths work
   - Created test project: `test-project` (Product type)
   - Successfully generated all files with correct structure
   - GitHub integration worked flawlessly
   - ✅ Skill confirmed working with new "Bawa's Lab" folder name

3. **Cleanup**
   - Deleted local `test-project` folder
   - Authenticated GitHub CLI with `delete_repo` scope
   - Deleted GitHub repo: `bawakul/test-project`
   - Deleted GitHub repo: `bawakul/test-skill-validation` (from earlier test)
   - All test artifacts removed

**Outcomes**:
- ✅ Folder rename fully complete and validated
- ✅ All tooling confirmed working with new structure
- ✅ Portfolio manager ready for production use
- ✅ Clean slate - no test repos cluttering GitHub

**Next Actions**:
- Review and potentially rewrite main `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Reflect on today's pivot and update portfolio manager role/scope

## 2025-11-03 - Claude.md Rewrite & Project Rename

**Context**: Clarifying portfolio manager role and resolving naming conflicts

**Session Activities**:

1. **Digital Garden Metaphor Discussion**
   - Identified naming conflict: portfolio is a "digital garden" AND there's a project called "digital-garden"
   - User confirmed the portfolio IS a digital garden of projects
   - Decision: Rename the knowledge management project to avoid confusion

2. **Project Rename: digital-garden → knowledge-gardener**
   - Renamed local folder: `digital-garden` → `knowledge-gardener`
   - Updated `Notes.md` with new title and metadata
   - Renamed GitHub repo: `bawakul/digital-garden` → `bawakul/knowledge-gardener`
   - Clean separation: portfolio = digital garden of projects, knowledge-gardener = tool for managing Obsidian notes

3. **Claude.md Rewrite**
   - Added "Digital Garden Caretaker" subtitle to clarify metaphor
   - Explained why digital garden approach works vs traditional PM tools
   - **Clarified current vs future phase:**
     - Current: Building infrastructure (skills, automation, tools)
     - Future: Using those tools for portfolio management
   - **Clear boundaries:**
     - DO work on portfolio-manager (build skills, commit code, infrastructure)
     - DON'T work inside individual projects (they have their own Claude sessions)
   - **Corrected skills section:**
     - Implemented: `/init-project` only
     - Planned: `/status`, `/sync`, `/review`

**Outcomes**:
- ✅ No more naming confusion between portfolio metaphor and project names
- ✅ Portfolio manager role clearly defined with explicit boundaries
- ✅ Current transition phase acknowledged (more tool-building now, less later)
- ✅ Honest about what skills exist vs what's planned
- ✅ Digital garden metaphor properly established

**Files Changed**:
- Renamed: `digital-garden/` → `knowledge-gardener/`
- Modified: `knowledge-gardener/Notes.md`
- Modified: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (complete rewrite)
- GitHub: Renamed `bawakul/digital-garden` → `bawakul/knowledge-gardener`

**Next Actions**:
- Commit these changes to portfolio-manager
- Begin building next skills (`/status`, `/sync`, `/review`)

## 2025-11-03 - Review Planning & Next Steps

**Context**: Planning first weekly review workflow and hitting context limits

**Session Activities**:

1. **Reviewed GitHub Issues**
   - 8 open issues in portfolio-manager repo
   - Issues #1-3: `/status`, `/sync`, `/review` skills
   - Issue #3 describes weekly review goal: markdown output for NotebookLM

2. **Review Approach Discussion**
   - **Original plan**: Build /review skill that reads Notes.md metadata
   - **Problem**: Notes.md files not yet populated (manual migration pending)
   - **Pivot**: Use existing data sources instead:
     - SESSIONS.md (detailed session notes)
     - GitHub commit activity (via `gh` CLI)
     - Local git logs

3. **Decision: One-Time Summary First**
   - Skip building /review skill for now
   - Generate one-time weekly review in fresh conversation (context at 54%)
   - Output: `_Portfolio/Reviews/2025-11-03.md` for NotebookLM
   - Build proper /review skill later when Notes.md files are populated

**Outcomes**:
- ✅ Validated that GitHub issues are up to date
- ✅ Clarified review workflow goal (markdown → NotebookLM audio)
- ✅ Pragmatic approach: use data we have now, enhance later
- ✅ Next conversation will generate the actual review

**Next Actions**:
- Start fresh conversation for weekly review generation
- Migrate running notes to portfolio Notes.md files (user will do manually)
- Later: Build proper /review skill when data sources are ready
